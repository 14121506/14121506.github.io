  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started of by knowing how to move left and right and that's about it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td>To make a spaceship shoot bullets at the evil spaceship/UFO.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>No as I didn’t make the UFO move side to side as it would in space invaders.</td>

    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>I was independant today as I didn't ask for any help and did all of the work by myself.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>I reflected today as in my previous blog I said to try new strategies and today I did exactly that as I forgot what code was on the board so I thought about how the game would go and in the end I succeeded.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>The things that could’ve gone better in my learning are trying the code somewhere else apart from my actual code as if it goes wrong, I would know where. I also could’ve asked  questions as I was unsure with some of the code but luckily it didn’t wreck my starting point on my game.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next time I could use a different page of scratch apart from my actual page as I could experiment more instead of actually ruining my game and that would help me answer all my questions and know what all the code does.</td>
