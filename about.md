Hey! Iâ€™m Varun. I love Harry Potter and the Percy Jackson series of books, (including the Heroes of Olympus). I obviously like reading, playing on my Xbox One S and Nintendo Switch so generally on some form of tech. I also love to code a robot arm!:)
PS:It was on FUZE.
### More Information


Yeah not much to say really. Anyways, why are you busy reading about my life and my hobbys instead of reading my blog............
