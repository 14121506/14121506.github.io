    <td>Persevering</td>

    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>I asked Mr Keen for help but he said he wouldn't help as this was supposed to be an independant task.</td>

    <td>I could’ve thought more creatively as I kept on trying to do the code in order but it always wasn’t so I had struggled for those kind of levels.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I need to learn to be able to think outside the box as I can think inside it and develop it but I can’t think outside of it. Once I have learned that, all of the code would be very easy to figure out.</td>
